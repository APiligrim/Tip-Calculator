## Notes

- The animation blocks were giving errors when I tried to make the text animation slowly appear
- In some cases I had to redesign the page from scratch because it was bringing up errors I could not find and debug them
- The gif is a little slow because it was created using imgflip ;  the Imgur file was not converting into a .gif format for    some reason
-I was using my friend's computer which is why the code might have a differnt copyright name
